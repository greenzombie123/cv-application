# Things I've Learned
- Learn how to make an application using React.
- Learn how to use various React hooks such as useContext and useEffect

# Things I have noticed
- Need to decide on the CSS design of the application before starting to write CSS. I wrote CSS haphazardly so it lacks cohesiveness.
- Avoid using the ternary operator to make nested conditionals. Makes the code confusing to read.
- Need to use Jest next time
- Need to learn when to make a component. It is probably not necessary to turn a single html element into a component.
