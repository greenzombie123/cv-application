Algorithm is a set of instructions for solving a problem
step by step instructions is a algorithm

```
decideFlavor(){}
if had something chocolate recently
	look at non-chocolate and non-vanilla flavors
	if flavor is citrisy 
		add to possible choices
		if completely new flavor
			choose that flavor
else find if there is chocolate chip and cookie dough
if no such flavor
	find if there is cookies and cream
		if there is such a flavor
			get that flavor
```

Recursion is the idea that a functions calls itself

Base of recurion is the obvious result 

Transform task into a simpler action
SImpler call of the same task
Recursion reduces a function call to a simpler one and continues to do so until the result becomes obvious

- Recursion Depth
The max number of nested calls

Execution Context is an internal data structure that contains details about the execution of a function.
Execustion Context Stack - remembers the execution context

Recursion can give a shorter code, easier to understand and support. Optimizations are not required in every place, mostly we need a good code, that’s why it’s used.

When we are talking about space complexity, we are actually talking about the **_memory_**.
