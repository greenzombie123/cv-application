Three trees (Git being a content manager of these three)

---
Tree               Role
HEAD             Last commit snapshot, next parent
Index              Proposed next commit snapshot       
Working Directory    Sandbox



HEAD is the pointer to the current branch reference. Its the snapshot of your last commit on that branch.

Index is your proposed next commit
